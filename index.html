      <h1>The Official Homepage of Chris Berns</h1>
      <p>I recently graduated NECC with an associates degree in Computer Science and a computer security certificate. 
        I am currently working on my Computer Science degree at UMASS Lowell. After an internship at BluBØX Security Inc. 
        I was able to continue my time with BluBØX as a Support and Technical Services Specialist. 
        This eventually resulted in split duties with engineering and operations, delivering quality of life solutions in the knowledge base and in BluSKY.
        Working for a startup, delivering an enterprise level solution has been one of the most challenging but rewarding experiences I've had so far. 
        It has given me an opportunity to work with some very talented people and learn a lot from them.
